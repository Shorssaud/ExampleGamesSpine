Unreal Project Setup and Launch Guide
Prerequisites
Unreal Engine installed on your PC (ensure the version matches the projectâ€™s version).
Sufficient disk space for the project files.
Project Structure
The project is located in the /example-game/ folder. This is an Unreal Engine project and is not a compiled game, but rather a working project with blueprints that can be opened and edited within Unreal Engine.

Steps to Download the Project from GitHub
Download as ZIP:

Open the GitHub repository in your browser.
Click the green Code button, and then select Download ZIP from the dropdown menu.
Save the ZIP file to a location on your computer.
Extract the ZIP File:

Navigate to where you saved the ZIP file.
Right-click the ZIP file and select Extract All (on Windows) or use your preferred extraction method (on macOS or Linux).
Choose a destination folder for the extracted files.
Download Project Dependencies:

If the project requires any additional assets or plugins, they may not be included in the ZIP. Unreal Engine will prompt you to download these when you open the project (instructions below).
Steps to Open the Project in Unreal Engine
Open the Project:

Launch Unreal Engine on your PC.
In the Unreal Engine launcher, click on Browse under the "Projects" tab.
Navigate to the folder where you extracted the project files.
Select the .uproject file in the example-game/ folder.
Click Open to load the project in Unreal Engine.
View and Edit Blueprints:

Once the project is open in Unreal Engine, you can access the blueprints by navigating to the Content Browser.
Look under the /Blueprints/ folder (or other designated folders) to find the relevant blueprint assets.
Double-click on any blueprint to open and edit it.
Additional Notes
Ensure you are using the correct version of Unreal Engine to avoid compatibility issues.
If any missing assets or plugins are required, Unreal Engine will prompt you to download or install them upon opening the project.
